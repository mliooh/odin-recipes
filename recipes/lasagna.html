    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is a homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
        <br> A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a
        blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green
        salad and crusty garlic bread.
