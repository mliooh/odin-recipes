    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is a homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
        <br> A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a
        blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green
        salad and crusty garlic bread.

            and

        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with
            mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>

        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and
